This project is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to perform basic mathematical operations such as calculating powers, factorials, and Fibonacci numbers. Itâ€™s built with Python and is organized in a modular way to keep the logic, data modeling, and database interactions separate and maintainable.

The user interacts with the tool through a terminal by passing in commands like pow, factorial, or fibonacci, followed by the necessary input values. The tool processes these inputs using a dedicated MathService class, which handles the core mathematical logic. For example, the factorial function uses recursion, while the Fibonacci sequence is computed iteratively for better performance.

One of the key features of this tool is its ability to log every request to a local SQLite database. Each request, along with its inputs, result, operation type, and timestamp, is saved automatically. This is managed by the Database class and uses a RequestModel defined with the help of Pydantic for data validation and timestamp generation.

The application is ideal for lightweight usage, educational purposes, or as a foundation for more advanced tools. It also demonstrates how to structure a Python CLI program with clear separation of concerns, making it easy to extend with additional features or operations in the future.
